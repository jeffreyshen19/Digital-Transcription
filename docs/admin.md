Admin accounts

To upload collections and review documents, you must create an admin account. For security reasons, this is done using a command line tool:

```
npm run admin
```

You will be prompted to enter a username, a name, and a password. Once successfully creating an admin account, you can log in to TranscribePA at /admin. There, you can upload collections, review transcriptions, and create or delete admin accounts using the web interface.
