# TranscribePA
An extensible platform for rapidly transcribing historical documents using machine-learning and crowdsourcing.

## Why? 

Many institutions like libraries and museums have large collections of scanned, handwritten or typed documents. However, since these documents are not transcribed, they can not be easily searched, read, or copy and pasted, greatly hindering the usefulness of these collections. TranscribePA aims to fix this issue, creating an extensible platform which leverages the power of machine learning and humans to rapidly convert pictures of document into actual text.  

### How Does It Work? 

Upload your institution's documents as collections. Once configuring a few settings, a machine learning algorithm will automatically go through each file and transcribe it. Then, users can use the online interface to edit or verify documents. 

## Features

* **Incredibly simple installation**: 

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/jeffreyshen19/TranscribePA
  cd TranscribePA
  npm run setup
  ```
* **Easily configurable**: Customize TranscribePA for your own institution, using just one config file.
