C. Lak, Angola, Indiana, My dear Luki Your Letter received this norning delighted ne more than I can tell you. Primarily I was glad to hear from you, but it was also a real satisfaction to note by the contents and form of your letter how much you have gained by your work of recent months. I think that wi thout exception thi s is about the best letter I have ever received from any of the naaerous Chinese boys who have been here, and I congratulate you on it. It is most certainly in marked contrast to one recsived several days ago from Fayuen Sun. The latter, by the way, seeas to have made little if any progress. His case is certainly a discouraging one. Your description of your work and the early hours at which you are obliged to start interests and auses me greatly. I wonder what our boya here would say if we should ask them to report at Chapel at geven o'clock in the morning. Not many years ago, however, the majority of our American educational institutions began work even earlier than this. If I am not mistaken, Amherst College once had its first exercise at six o'clock in the norning. That sort of life will do you good, however, provided you start to bed early enough in the avening. He sure to get the proper amount of sleep. If you have that and also the necessary out-of-door exercise, the early rising will do you more good than hari. I cannot tell you how pleased I ar to know that you are 30 satisfied with your new surroundings. That you will make the best po ssible use of your opportunities I an absolutely confident. Your progress will always | interest me deaply and I shall be glad to hear from you whenever you can find the time and inclination to write.
