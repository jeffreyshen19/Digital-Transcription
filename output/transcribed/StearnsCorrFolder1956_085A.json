C. Luk,  Angola, Indiana.  My dear luk:  Your letter received this morning delighted me more than I can  tell you. Primarily I was glad to hear from you, but it was also a real  satisfaction to note by the contents and form of your letter how much you  have gained by your work of recent months.  I think that without exception this is about the best letter I have ever received from any of the  numerous Chinese boys who have been here, and I congratulate you on it.  It is most certainly in marked contrast to one recsived several days ago  from Fayuen Sun.  The latter, by the way, seeas to have made little is  any progress.  His case is certainly a discouraging one.  Your description of your work and the early hours at which you are  obliged to start interests and  uses ne greatly.  I wonder what our boya  here would say if we should ask them to report at Chapel et geven o'clock  in the morning.  Not many years ago, however, the majority of our American  educational institutions began work even earlier than this.  If I am not  misteken, Amherst College once had its first exercise at six o'clock in the  morning.  That sort of life will  do you good, however, provided you start  to bed early enough in the evening.  we sure to get the proper amount of  sleep.  If you have that and also the necessary out-of-door exercise, the  early rising will do you more good than herm.  I cannot tell you how pleased I am to know that you are so satisfied with your new surroundings.  That you will make the best possible use  of your opportunities I an absolutely confident. Your progress will always  interest me desply and I shall be glad to hear from you whenever you can find  the time and inclination to write.  Every detail of your life will interest  Me.
