Stearns apologizes for writing about the deficit of $985.36 in the account; states he was reluctant to bring this up given the financial situation in China and for individuals. He notes that he would like to have the account settled, and that, since the Sun brothers and others have maintained generous  balances, he has not had to draw on funds external to the Chinese students' overall balance, except for in a few instances. Further, should the Sun brothers leave Andover, it will be necessary to take steps to charge interest on funds applied from other sources. He expresses his regret about the situation and closes with saying that he misses Sung Sing and wishes that China will reach its potential and high ideals.", "note_general": "", "note_date": "", "note_acquisition": "", "note_preferred-citation": "", "subject_LCSH": "", "subject_LCSH_valueURI": "", "subject_name": "Phillips Academy", "subject_name_type": "corporate", "subject_name_auth": "naf", "subject_name_valueURI": "http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79058957", "subject_geo_TGN_id": "7013301", "collection": "Head of School (Stearns) correspondence with Chinese alumni", "series": "Correspondence with Chinese Alumni", "physical-location": "Phillips Academy Andover", "physical-location_department": "Archives and Special Collections", "rights": "We believe that this item has no known US copyright restrictions.
