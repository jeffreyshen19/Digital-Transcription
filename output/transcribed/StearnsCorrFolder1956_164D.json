Nanking. Kwan regrets not seeing Stearns as he made his final calls prior to his departure from Andover. He traveled with a party of 9 to Buffalo, Chicago, and San Francisco, where they were delayed by a strike of riggers, stevedores, and teamsters. Once at sea, the trip was very rough. The ship had entertainment by minstrels, bands, and orchestras and there were jokes about President Wilson and England. Kwan describes the passengers. He closes the letter since they are approaching Yokohama. He notes that Miss Lee is unwell, but she sends regards to Stearns.
