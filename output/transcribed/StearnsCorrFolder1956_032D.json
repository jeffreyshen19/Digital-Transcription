Whitmore. The delay did not affect Kwan's entry into Tech. Kwan lists his grades and states that German is his hardest subject, but he is improving and is satisfied with his work overall. He is deciding on his professional course and has sleepless nights as a result. He has dropped the idea of architecture and is considering civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and naval architecture. He seeks Stearns' advice. He asks about the fire in Bartlett Hall and is shocked by this event. Kwan asks about Sun Fayuan's deposit since Kwan introduced Sun to the owner of the Shanghai Low restaurant and Sun borrowed $120 from him. Kwan wishes to reply to Mr. Wong about this loan, because Wong is in need of money. He asks Stearns if there is any money left in Sun's account because he would like to pursue repayment, if Stearns agrees that this is possible. He says that Chinese students may visit over Christmas and he will be looking for rooms for them. He closes by asking about Mrs. Stearns' health and recovery.", "note_general": "", "note_date": "", "note_acquisition": "Phillips Academy Archives and Special Collections received the letters and materials of Sung Sing Kwan from Alfred E.
