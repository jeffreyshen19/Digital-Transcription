On Commencement Day, Mr. Tsur stated that there would be a delay in students' arrivals in Andover because of funding. He hopes that a millionaire who has helped in the past will provide funds, enabling the boys to arrive by Christmas. He visited Hong Kong and Canton and met with friends, including K.T. Tsai, Y.S. Wong, S.Y. Yung. He relates that he was named a commissioner by the Governor of Kwongtung to bring 8 boys 11-12 years old, to the Tsing Hua middle school. Unexpectedly, he was given a stipend of $150, the first payment he has received for service. On this trip from Canton, there was a very rough passage, which he describes in detail, and due to the typhoon, there was a stop in Hong Kong. He was unable to accompany the others to Shanghai and muses on the disadvantages of sea travel, even if compensated for this service. He reports the death of Mr. Tongkaison and encloses the piece from the National Review (August 30, 1913). He states that he is staying with Mrs. Tong, helping with packing and correspondence, until Mr. Tsur's return. Kwan has decided to study architecture and asks for advice on a choice of college. His father has resigned from the Medical College and sends regards. Kwan requests that this letter be sent to Mrs. Hall. He encloses the Resolution of Respect for Mr. Tongkaison issued by the YMCA of China on September 23, 1913.", "note_general": "", "note_date": "", "note_acquisition": "", "note_preferred-citation": "", "subject_LCSH": "", "subject_LCSH_valueURI": "", "subject_name": "Phillips Academy", "subject_name_type": "corporate", "subject_name_auth": "naf", "subject_name_valueURI": "http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79058957", "subject_geo_TGN_id": "7013301", "collection": "Head of School (Stearns) correspondence with Chinese alumni", "series": "Correspondence with Chinese Alumni", "physical-location": "Phillips Academy Andover", "physical-location_department": "Archives and Special Collections", "rights": "We believe that this item has no known US copyright restrictions.
