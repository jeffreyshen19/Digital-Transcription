My dear Dr. Kwan:  When your boy left us last year to return to China, I went  over with him in detail his financial statement, and asked him to explain the  situation fully to you on his return to China.  On the 24th of November, 1911, I forwarded a sta tenant to that  date, showing a deficit of $981.36. Since that time I have paid 0-9 addtrional bill, that of Dr. Albert s. Hulme of this town, for dentist, to the  amount of $4.00.  The total overdraft to da te, therefore, is $985.36.  I have desired to do nothing that would convey the impression  that I was unduly anxious about this account, and hence have not written  about it before.  I realize also that the unsettled conditions in China to day  must have their effect on the financial situation in general and on the means  of individuals; consequently I have been more than ever reluctant to urge  an early settlement.  I can continue to carry the account for a time longer,  and will gladly do so in case you desire to hero one.  On the other hand, it  would be a convenience to have the matter settled at a comparatively early  date if it is reasonable to make this request.  Several of our other Chinese  boys, notably the Sun brothers, have generally kept fairly generous balances  on hand, and kr. Tong Kaison, who has been ay chief adviser in regard to these  boys, had authorized de to draw from individual surplus funds in the cases of  boys who might be temporarily behind in their own funds. In this way it  has not been necessary for ne generally to borrow outside, and hence be  compelled to meet interest charges. On one or two occasions, however, I  have had to do this.

Stearns apologizes for writing about the deficit of $985.36 in the account; states he was reluctant to bring this up given the financial situation in China and for individuals. He notes that he would like to have the account settled, and that, since the Sun brothers and others have maintained generous  balances, he has not had to draw on funds external to the Chinese students' overall balance, except for in a few instances. Further, should the Sun brothers leave Andover, it will be necessary to take steps to charge interest on funds applied from other sources. He expresses his regret about the situation and closes with saying that he misses Sung Sing and wishes that China will reach its potential and high ideals.", "note_general": "", "note_date": "", "note_acquisition": "", "note_preferred-citation": "", "subject_LCSH": "", "subject_LCSH_valueURI": "", "subject_name": "Phillips Academy", "subject_name_type": "corporate", "subject_name_auth": "naf", "subject_name_valueURI": "http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79058957", "subject_geo_TGN_id": "7013301", "collection": "Head of School (Stearns) correspondence with Chinese alumni", "series": "Correspondence with Chinese Alumni", "physical-location": "Phillips Academy Andover", "physical-location_department": "Archives and Special Collections", "rights": "We believe that this item has no known US copyright restrictions.
