Further, he was about to go to Hamilton, NY with friends. Cunningham states that this letter would have delighted him, if not for the fact that Luk would not attend camp. He explains that the camp was not established for personal profit. Rather, it is intended to provide a summer study opportunity and the fact that Luk was not attending had a bearing on their financial standing. He asks Stearns to make thi all clear to Luk, and to impress upon him the ideals of Anglo-Saxon honor; while Luk may not realize it, he has greatly inconvenienced them.", "note_general": "", "note_date": "", "note_acquisition": "", "note_preferred-citation": "", "subject_LCSH": "", "subject_LCSH_valueURI": "", "subject_name": "Phillips Academy", "subject_name_type": "corporate", "subject_name_auth": "naf", "subject_name_valueURI": "http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79058957", "subject_geo_TGN_id": "7013301", "collection": "Head of School (Stearns) correspondence with Chinese alumni", "series": "Correspondence with Chinese Alumni", "physical-location": "Phillips Academy Andover", "physical-location_department": "Archives and Special Collections", "rights": "We believe that this item has no known US copyright restrictions.
