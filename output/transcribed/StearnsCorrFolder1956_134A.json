He explains that the camp was not established for personal profit. Rather, it is intended to provide a summer study opportunity and the fact that Luk was not attending had a bearing on their financial standing. He asks Stearns to make thi all clear to Luk, and to impress upon him the ideals of Anglo-Saxon honor; while Luk may not realize it, he has greatly inconvenienced them.", "note_general": "", "note_date": "", "note_acquisition": "", "note_preferred-citation": "", "subject_LCSH": "", "subject_LCSH_valueURI": "", "subject_name": "Phillips Academy", "subject_name_type": "corporate", "subject_name_auth": "naf", "subject_name_valueURI": "http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n79058957", "subject_geo_TGN_id": "7013301", "collection": "Head of School (Stearns) correspondence with Chinese alumni", "series": "Correspondence with Chinese Alumni", "physical-location": "Phillips Academy Andover", "physical-location_department": "Archives and Special Collections", "rights": "We believe that this item has no known US copyright restrictions.
