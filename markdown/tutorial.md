# Transcription Tips

  * **Move from top to down and left to right**. Not all documents will have clean formatting, and text may scattered across a page. Nevertheless, aim to transcribe the document starting from the top left and moving down and to the right.
  * **Transcribe text *exactly* as it appears**, even if spelling or punctuation on the original document is incorrect.
  * **Preserve the format of the original document**. After each line break on the original document, insert a newline, and insert line breaks to demarcate new paragraphs. Doing so will greatly improve readability of the transcription.
  * **Ignore emphasis**. Transcribe italic, bold, and otherwise emphasized text as you would plain text.
  * **Acknowledge non-text elements**. Some documents may contain stamps, seals, images, or other non-text elements. Attempt to transcribed these if possible, but if not, mark them within square brackets. For example, transcribe a stamp as \[Stamp\].
  * **Attempt to transcribe unreadable or erased text**. Demarcate a word or string of words you can't read with a pair of square brackets around an empty space (i.e. "I like drinking [ ] tea"). For words you can partially read, transcribe as much as you can, and use question marks for the other characters (i.e. "I like drinking [??a??i?n?]"). For crossed out, erased, or otherwise deleted text that you can still read, transcribe the deleted words within square brackets (i.e. "I like [sipping] drinking tea").
